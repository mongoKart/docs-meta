Hyperlinks
==========

You can link out to other sites, internal pages or sections using inline
hyperlinks and cross-referenced hyperlinks.

Inline Hyperlinks
-----------------

Use inline hyperlinks when you want to link to a full URL.

Syntax
~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

   `your text <your link>`__

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. step:: Start with a backtick ``\```.

   .. step:: Insert the text you want displayed.

   .. step:: Put your URL between the angle brackets ``<>``.

   .. step:: Close with another backtick ``\```.

   .. step:: Append 2 underscores ``__``. This tells Sphinx and docutils to treat
      each link as unique when converting to it HTML.

Example
```````

.. code-block:: none

   Here is the `MongoDB Go Driver Documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/>`__.

Cross-Referenced Hyperlinks
---------------------------

Use cross-referenced hyperlinks when you want to link to another page in
docs. This page can be in the same repo, or another within the same
organization.

Syntax
~~~~~~

To create a cross-referenced hyperlink:

.. code-block:: none

    .. _some-link:

To reference a cross-referenced hyperlink:

.. code-block:: none

    :ref:`Some Text <some-link>`

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. step:: At the line before where you want to link to, create the cross-referenced hyperlink.
    
    .. procedure::
      :style:  connected
      
      .. step:: Start with two periods ``..``.

      .. step:: Enter a space `` ``.

      .. step:: Add an underscore ``_`` followed with the text you want displayed.
   
      .. step:: Close with a colon ``:``.

   .. step:: Reference the cross-referenced hyperlink.
    
      .. procedure::
         :style:  connected
      
         .. step:: Start with the ref tag ``:ref:``.

         .. step:: Add a backtick ``\```.

         .. step:: Insert the text you want displayed.

            You can omit ``Some Text`` if its the same as the heading
            below the reference. 

         .. step:: Put your URL between the angle brackets ``<>``.

         .. step:: Close with another backtick ``\```.    

Example
```````
