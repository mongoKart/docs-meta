Hyperlinks
==========

You can link out to other sites, internal pages or specific sections on
a page using inline hyperlinks and cross-referenced hyperlinks.

Inline Hyperlinks
-----------------

Use inline hyperlinks when you want to link to a website with its full URL.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: rst

   Here is the `MongoDB Go Driver Documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/>`__.

Here is the `MongoDB Go Driver Documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/>`__.

Cross-Referenced Hyperlinks
---------------------------

Use cross-referenced hyperlinks when you want to link to another page in
docs. This page can be in the same repo, or another within the ``MongoDB``
organization.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. step:: Check if the cross-referenced hyperlink exists.

      If the cross-referenced hyperlink is in a different MongoDB repo, 
      add the documentation URL landing page and append
      ``/objects.inv``. Then, add the URL to the  ``intersphinx`` array
      in the ``snooty.toml`` file and skip the next step.

      For example, if you want to use hyperlinks in the manual, you'd
      add this to the ``intersphinx`` array:

      .. code-block:: rst

         https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/objects.inv

      If someone else already created the hyperlink in the same repo,
      skip the next step.
   
   .. step:: Create the cross-referenced hyperlink.
      
      Place your cross-referenced hyperlink a line before where you 
      want the reference to be.

      .. note::

         You need to place this two lines before where you want the link
         to.

   .. step:: Reference the cross-referenced hyperlink.  

Example
```````

The following example creates a cross-referenced hyperlink to the top of
this page.

This is the first line of this page:

.. code-block:: rst
