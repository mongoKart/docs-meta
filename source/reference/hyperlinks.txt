Hyperlinks
==========

You can link out to other sites, internal pages or sections using inline
hyperlinks and cross-referenced hyperlinks.

Inline Hyperlinks
-----------------

Use inline hyperlinks when you want to link to a full URL.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: rst

   Here is the `MongoDB Go Driver Documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/>`__.

Cross-Referenced Hyperlinks
---------------------------

Use cross-referenced hyperlinks when you want to link to another page in
docs. This page can be in the same repo, or another within the same
organization.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. step:: If the hyperlink doesn't already exist, in the line before where you want to link to, create the cross-referenced hyperlink.

      If the hyperlink is in a different repo, add the rendered docs URL
      landing page and append ``objects.inv``. Add the URL to the
      ``intersphinx`` array in the ``snooty.toml`` file.

      For example, if you want to use hyperlinks in the manual, you'd
      add this to the ``intersphinx`` array:

      .. code-block:: rst

         https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/objects.inv

   .. step:: Reference the cross-referenced hyperlink.  

Example
