Use over and underlines consisting of a repeating character to specify a heading
in rST.

Heading Level Markup
--------------------

The character used for the over and underlines has no effect on the heading
level. Snooty determines the heading levels based on the order in which it first 
sees the character on the page. However, to maintain consistency and readability 
throughout the documentation, use the following heading level structure:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30 10 40 10

   * - Heading Level
     - Character
     - Under or Overline
     - Common Usage
     - Renders in HTML as

   * - 1
     - ``=`` (Equals sign)
     - Both
     - Page Titles Only
     - ``<h1>``

   * - 2
     - ``-`` (Hyphen)
     - Under
     - Main Headings
     - ``<h2>``

   * - 3
     - ``~`` (Tilde)
     - Under
     - Subheadings
     - ``<h3>``

   * - 4
     - ````` (Backtick)
     - Under
     - 2nd Level Subheadings
     - ``<h4>``

   * - 5
     - ``+`` (Plus sign)
     - Under
     - 3rd Level Subheadings
     - ``<h5>``

Heading Markup Rules
--------------------

Headings must follow these rules to prevent build errors:

- Make the underline at least as long as the text above it.

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 50 50

     * - Use
       - Avoid

     * -

         .. code-block:: rst
            :copyable: false

            Create One New User
            -------------------

       -

         .. code-block:: rst
            :copyable: false

            Create One New User
            --------------

- When using both over and underlines, their lengths must be identical.

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 50 50

     * - Use
       - Avoid

     * -

         .. code-block:: rst
            :copyable: false

            -------------------
            Create One New User
            -------------------

       -

         .. code-block:: rst
            :copyable: false

            -------------
            Create One New User
            -------------------

- Don't skip Heading Levels. Heading Level 3 should not come after
  Heading Level 1.

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 50 50

     * - Use
       - Avoid

     * -

         .. code-block:: rst
            :copyable: false

- Write all headings in 
  `title case <https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case>`_. 
  Capitalize all words, except for minor words like articles and short conjunctions.
  
- Avoid using {+rst+} replacements, such as :ref:`style-guide-source-constants`,
  in heading text. If the replacement text makes the heading text longer than the
  underline length, your build generates an error. Replacements also make no 
  guarantees about capitalization, which could lead to a heading not being title
  case.

For more guidelines on headings, see :ref:`titles-and-headings`.
