Footnotes
=========

Use footnotes to add details that not all readers will need.

Procedure
---------
.. procedure::
    :style: normal

    .. step:: Mark the footnote location in your text with ``[#footnote-identifier]``,
        where "footnote-identifier" is arbitrary. 

    .. step:: If the bottom of the page doesn't have a "Footnotes" rubric, use 
        ``.. rubric:: Footnotes`` to create one.
    
    .. step:: Beneath the "Footnotes" rubric, enter  ``.. [#footnote-identifier] 
                <footnote text>`` to add your footnote.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: rst

    This sentence ends with a footnote. [#first-footnote]_
    This sentence ends with a different footnote. [#second-footnote]_
    Two sentences can use the same footnote. [#first-footnote]_

    This describes something cool.
    This goes into more detail.
    Now you've learned this cool thing!
    Footnotes will appear below.

    .. rubric:: Footnotes
    .. [#first-footnote] This footnote supplements the first and third sentences above.
    .. [#second-footnote] This footnote supplements the second sentence above.
