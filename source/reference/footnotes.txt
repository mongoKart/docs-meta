Footnotes
=========

Use footnotes for tangential explanations of greater technical depth that build
understanding but can be ignored.

Use ``[#footnote-identifier]`` to mark the footnote location in the text:

.. code-block:: rst

    This sentence ends with a footnote.[#first-footnote]
    This sentence also ends with a footnote.[#second-footnote]  
    The same footnote can be added to multiple sentences.[#first-footnote]

Add the footnotes to the bottom of the page. It's best practice to place them 
beneath a "Footnotes" rubric heading:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. rubric:: Footnotes
    .. [#first-footnote] This footnote supplements the first and third sentences above.
    .. [#second-footnote] This footnote supplements the second sentence above.
