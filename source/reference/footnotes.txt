Footnotes
=========

Limit footnotes to tangential explanations of greater technical depth that build
understanding but can be ignored.

Use ``[#footnote-identifier]`` to mark the footnote location in the text, then add the 
footnote to the bottom of the page. It's best practice to place footnotes beneath a
"Footnotes" rubric heading:

.. code-block:: rst

    This sentence ends with a footnote.[#first-footnote]
    This sentence also ends with a footnote.[#second-footnote]  

    .. rubric:: Footnotes
    .. [#first-footnote] This footnote supplements the first sentence above.
    .. [#second-footnote] This footnote supplements the second sentence above.

Note that the same footnote can be used in multiple locations.
