Footnotes
=========

Use footnotes to add detail that not all readers will need.

Syntax
------

.. procedure::
    :style: normal

    .. step: Use ``[#footnote-identifier]`` to mark the footnote location in the text.
    .. step: Add the footnote to the bottom of the page. It's best practice to place 
       footnotes beneath a ``Footnotes`` rubric heading.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: rst

    This sentence ends with a footnote.[#first-footnote]
    This sentence also ends with a footnote.[#second-footnote]
    Two sentences can use the same footnote.[#first-footnote]

    .. rubric:: Footnotes
    .. [#first-footnote] This footnote supplements the first and third sentences above.
    .. [#second-footnote] This footnote supplements the second sentence above.
